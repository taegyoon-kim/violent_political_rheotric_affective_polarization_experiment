# Violent Political Rhetoric on Social Media and Affective Polarization

## About

How does exposure to social media content promoting political violence influence affective polarization? Although existing research reveals that engaging in political communication on social media can be highly consequential for mass political polarization, little is known about how exposure to content promoting political violence shapes the level of affective polarization. I claim that social media posts promoting political violence have heterogeneous effects depending on its partisan source. While exposure to threats from the opposing party leads to affective po- larization by triggering anger, exposure to threats from one’s own party contributes to affective depolarization by evoking collective shame. Furthermore, I also examine the moderating effect of the social status of those who deliver violence-promoting content. I test my arguments using a two (threat vs. non-threat) × two (in-party vs. out-party) experiment where participants are treated to four different versions of fabricated social media posts on a set of controversial political issues.
